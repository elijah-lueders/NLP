Boylston also delves into her experience guesting with the Paris Opéra Ballet, her dream of choreographing an avant-garde ballet on Whiteside to a Carly Rae Jepsen song and best and worst Kennedy Center memories (like the time she fell onstage while doing fouettés at the end of La Bayadère's first act).\\nWhiteside, on the other hand, imitates a unicorn, talks about preparing for roles and creates a new middle name for Boylston. The twosome also offer heartfelt advice for aspiring professional dancers.\\nCheck out the highlights in this video below; for the full 24-minute version, click here.\",\n",

The title of Ekman\\'s version, which premiered with the Royal Swedish Ballet in 2015, refers not to Shakespeare but to Midsummer, the traditional Scandinavian summer solstice festival. The piece follows a young man through a day of revelry followed by a nightmare, blurring the line with reality. \"It\\'s a kind of otherworldly dream,\" says Wheater.\\nBringing Ekman\\'s production to life is no small feat; the piece utilizes the entire Joffrey company. \"I can\\'t think of another performance that has so many props,\" says Wheater, listing giant bales of hay, long banquet tables, umbrellas, beach chairs and more. The piece features a commissioned score by Swedish composer Mikael Karlsson, which will be performed onstage by singer Anna von Hausswolff. \"She is very much a part of the performance; she\\'s kind of the narrator,\" says Wheater. Dancers also contribute to the narration with spoken text, including imagery of young love and a dose of humor.\\nThe Royal Swedish Ballet in Alexander Ekman\\'s \"Midsummer Night\\'s Dream.\" Photo by Hans Nilsson, Courtesy Joffrey Ballet.\\nThis will be the fourth work by Ekman that The Joffrey has performed. \"I think it says something that Alex trusts us to bring the work to its full realization,\" says Wheater. \"It\\'s not just a few ballet steps here and there; he asks you to fully engage with yourself, not only as a dancer but as an actor and a person.\" Ekman\\'s Midsummer will run April 25–May 6 at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.',\n",
